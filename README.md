# OOP-project
My university's Object Orianted Programming project.
This project was to demonstrate the fundamentals of object-orianted programming.
I made a university registration system that adds a new student,course or lecturer and display all the courses for a specific  lecturer or a student. 
And there are more functionalities added to the project
